<p> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... <p>

<ol>
<li> HTML is cool
<li> CSS is cooler
 <li> JS is the best
   </ol>
 </p>

<h2><em> What do you need to create a website? </em> </<h1>

<P> Not much!

  <ul>
<li> A computer (always a good start)
<li> A text editor (I am using atom)
<li> A web browser (I am using chrome)
<li> Some HTML, CSS and JS files
</ul>
</p>
